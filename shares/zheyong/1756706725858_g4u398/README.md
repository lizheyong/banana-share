Generate 4 consecutive story images of the same characters and setting, keeping the signboard text unchanged.

Image 1: A man arrives in the scene.  
Image 2: The man inserts a coin for the girl, and the girl looks up at him.  
Image 3: The girl stands and bows politely to thank him.  
Image 4: The man turns and leaves, walking away from the scene.  

Keep the visual style consistent across all images. The characters should remain recognizable as the same individuals throughout the sequence.
